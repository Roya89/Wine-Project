## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Wine Quality dataset, containing physicochemical properties of red and white wine samples, to develop a system that predicts wine quality **and recommends optimal pricing strategies** for Blueberry Winery. By analyzing features such as alcohol content, acidity, and density, and applying machine learning models, this project seeks to provide insights into the factors influencing sensory scores assigned by wine experts. **The process covers data preparation, model training, and validation techniques, emphasizing balanced accuracy through cross-validation and oversampling. Additionally, the project outlines key recommendations for refining the pricing model and enhancing wine quality, ensuring fair, data-driven decision-making for the winery.**

## Dataset Details

**Title: Wine Quality** <br>
The dataset consists of two subsets corresponding to red wine **(1599 instances) and white wine (4898 instances)** samples from Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy constraints, only physicochemical inputs and sensory output variables are included (e.g., grape types, wine brand, or price are not available).<br>
